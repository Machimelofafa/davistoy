# Stack-up Rth & DeltaT Calculator

This repository hosts a Google Apps Script web application designed to estimate the thermal resistance (Rth) and temperature rise (Î”T) of multi-layer material stack-ups, commonly found in electronic assemblies. It provides a comprehensive tool for thermal analysis, accounting for complex heat spreading phenomena and multi-die configurations.

## Key Features

*   **Anisotropic Heat Spreading:** Accurately models heat flow considering different thermal conductivities in the XY-plane and Z-direction.
*   **Advanced Multi-Die Support:** Analyze thermal interactions for various die layouts, including 'Line', '2-Lines', 'Quincunx', and 'Custom' arrangements, to determine maximum and average die temperatures.
*   **Temperature Rise Calculation:** Directly computes temperature increase (Î”T in Â°C) based on per-die power dissipation.
*   **Detailed Visualizations:** Offers insightful graphical representations, including X and Y-axis side views of heat dissipation and a top-down view of die layouts with final heat spread areas.
*   **Cooling Model:** Incorporates a cooling model using a convection coefficient based on the final spread area.
*   **Sensitivity Analysis:** Identifies critical layers and parameters that significantly impact thermal performance.
*   **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Quantifies uncertainty by assessing the impact of manufacturing tolerances and material variations on Rth.
*   **Parameter Sweep:** Allows sweeping a chosen layer parameter over a range to observe its effect on total Rth.
*   **Save/Load Configurations:** Enables saving and loading of stack-up configurations directly within the browser for easy design iteration and comparison.
*   **Progress and Error Reporting:** Provides clear feedback on calculation progress and highlights invalid inputs.

## Getting Started

This web application is built using Google Apps Script. To use it, you need to import the code into your Google Drive and deploy it as a web app.

### Import into Google Apps Script

1.  Open [script.new](https://script.new) to create a new, blank Google Apps Script project.
2.  Replace the default `Code.gs` content with the content from this repository's `Code.gs` file.
3.  Create new HTML files in your Apps Script project named `index.html`, `controls.html`, `ui.html`, and `styles.html`. Copy the respective contents from this repository into these new files.
4.  Open the project manifest file (`appsscript.json`) and replace its contents with the version provided in this repository.

### Deploy as a Web App

1.  In the Google Apps Script editor, navigate to **Deploy > New deployment**.
2.  Select **Web app** as the deployment type.
3.  Provide a descriptive name for your deployment and configure the execution and access settings as needed (e.g., 


Execute as: `Me` (your Google account) and Who has access: `Anyone` (or `Anyone with Google account` if you want to restrict access).
4.  Click **Deploy** and authorize the script if prompted.

After successful deployment, you will receive a web app URL. Visiting this URL in your browser will load the `index.html` and launch the Rth Calculator.

## Basic Usage

1.  **Define Heat Source:** Input the heat source dimensions (length and width), number of dies, power per die, and select a die layout (Line, 2-Lines, Quincunx, or Custom). For custom layouts, provide semicolon-separated coordinates.
2.  **Build Stack-Up:** Add material layers sequentially from the heat source to the cooler. For each layer, specify its material name, thickness (Âµm), in-plane thermal conductivity (kxy in W/(mÂ·K)), and through-plane thermal conductivity (kz in W/(mÂ·K)).
3.  **Configure Cooling:** Choose your cooling method: `None`, `Direct Rth` (specify a fixed thermal resistance), or `Convection` (specify a convection coefficient).
4.  **Calculate:** Click the "Calculate" button to perform the thermal analysis.
5.  **Analyze Results:** Review the primary outputs (Î”T per die, total stack Rth), detailed visualizations (X/Y axis thermal dissipation, top view layout), and the summary table which breaks down Rth contributions, cumulative Rth, and sensitivity indices for each layer.
6.  **Explore Advanced Features:** Use the "Monte Carlo" button to run uncertainty quantification or "Run Sweep Analysis" to plot the effect of varying a single parameter.
7.  **Save/Load:** Utilize the "ðŸ’¾ Save Stack" and "ðŸ“‚ Load Stack" buttons to save and retrieve your current stack-up configurations.

## Calculation Approach

The solver employs a detailed layer-by-layer approach:

*   **Slice-based Calculation:** Each material layer is divided into 1 Âµm slices. The vertical resistance is calculated for each slice, and the heat-spreading footprint is updated based on angles derived from the conductivity ratios.
*   **Anisotropic Spreading:** The model accounts for anisotropic heat spreading by tracking widths in the X and Y directions separately.
*   **Cumulative Resistance:** Resistance is accumulated slice by slice. The calculation aborts if the cumulative Rth exceeds `RTH_LIMIT` (100 Â°C/W) to prevent runaway values.
*   **Cooler Model Integration:** After processing all layers, the selected cooler model (direct resistance or convection based on the final spread area) is added to determine the per-die and total stack resistance.
*   **Lateral Coupling:** For multi-die configurations, the tool computes overlap areas between die footprints across layers to build a conductance matrix, accounting for lateral thermal coupling.
*   **System Solution:** A matrix system is solved to obtain die temperatures, from which the maximum and average temperature rises, and overall stack resistance, are derived.

## Assumptions & Limitations

*   **Units:**
    *   Heat source length and width are entered in **millimeters (mm)**.
    *   Layer thicknesses are in **micrometers (Âµm)**.
    *   Thermal conductivities (kxy, kz) are in **W/(mÂ·K)**.
    *   Results (Rth) are reported in **Â°C/W**.
*   **Homogeneity:** Each layer is considered homogeneous.
*   **Idealized Spreading:** Heat spreading is idealized as described in the calculation approach.
*   **Rth Limit:** Calculations stop if cumulative Rth exceeds 100 Â°C/W.
